# Ansible-Playbooks
This repo is used to store all the ansible-playbooks which I have created.
Here, I have configured one ansible_master instance and three ansible_host instances.

I'm playing around how we can write ansible-playbooks to configure the host machines through master machine.

I tried creating a users on host machines, Installing Apache, Tomcat, Java JDK16 etc.
